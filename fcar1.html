                        <p>Pros<br>
                            Sharp handling and smooth driving character<br>
                            Comfortable interior that's easy to get in and out of<br>
                            Big cargo area for a little SUV<br>
                            Impressive technology features<br>
                            Cons<br>
                            Transmission can be slow to frustratingly slow to downshift<br>
                            Noticeable road and engine noise at highway speeds<br>
                            What's new<br>
                            All-new two-row subcompact SUV that slots below the Tiguan
                            2022 model introduces the first generation of the Taos
                            With the all-new 2022 Volkswagen Taos, VW is filling out its SUV lineup with a new entry-level model that provides more style, interior room and driving satisfaction than many rivals. Smaller and more affordable than the automaker's Tiguan, the Taos is sized and priced to compete against the likes of the Honda HR-V and Mazda CX-30.
                            <br>
                            The Taos is impressive from the moment you sit inside. All Taos models come standard with a digital instrument cluster that can be customized to display anything from the song that's playing to turn-by-turn directions, whether from the navigation system or from your phone via Apple CarPlay or Android Auto smartphone integration. There's also some nice-looking materials, roomy seating and lots of cargo space for a little SUV.
                            <br>
                            Overall, we think Volkswagen has a compelling SUV on its hands. The Taos offers comparable sophistication and not much of a trade-off in cargo space compared to its Tiguan stablemate, but at a lower price. Check out our Expert Rating below for more detail on what our test team has found to be the Taos' strengths and weaknesses.
