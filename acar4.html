Pros<br>
Super fun to drive thanks to precise handling and steering<br>
Simple and driver-friendly control layout<br>
Ride quality is pretty agreeable for a sports car<br>
Cons<br>
Cramped back seats and tight storage<br>
Elevated noise levels on the highway<br>
Lackluster touchscreen and audio system<br>
What's new<br>
Redesigned for 2022<br>
New 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with more power<br>
Updated interior and driver-focused technology features<br>
Kicks off the second BRZ generation<br>
Just about every Subaru these days is an all-wheel-drive SUV, but not the Subaru BRZ. This is the company's low-slung, rear-wheel-drive sport coupe co-developed with Toyota, and now it has a fresh lease on life for 2022 thanks to a full redesign.<br>

The 2022 BRZ still has the same key attributes that made the first-generation 2013-2020 car so appealing, such as its light weight, back-to-basics rear-wheel-drive architecture and affordable-for-the-masses pricing. But it also has some key improvements, including a more powerful engine, fresh exterior styling and some updated tech on the inside.<br>

Replacing the previous 2.0-liter engine is a 2.4-liter flat-four making 228 horsepower and 184 lb-ft, an increase of 23 hp and 28 lb-ft over the previous model. This engine is smoother, sounds better, and delivers a much more satisfying midrange punch of power. Handling has improved too, thanks in large part to optional grippy summer tires, as well as minor but important tweaks to the chassis and suspension. Subaru has even added a suite of advanced aids, known as EyeSight, to BRZs equipped with automatic transmissions.<br>

Overall, we're impressed with the new BRZ and find it to be a great pick for a low-priced performance car. Read our Expert Rating to get our test team's full analysis of its performance, comfort and more.<br>

Wildcard	9.5<br>
Which BRZ does Edmunds recommend?<br>
Of the two available trim levels, we'd put our money on the Limited. Stepping up to this trim gets you grippier, higher-performance summer tires on 18-inch wheels plus other nice-to-have features such as blind-spot monitoring, heated front seats, faux suede upholstery and adaptive headlights. Getting the manual transmission enhances driving enjoyment, but choosing it means you lose out on some of the car's available driving aids.
